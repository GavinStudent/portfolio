                        <h3>ARMv7 Assembly Code Calculator</h3>
                        <p>This project entailed having to create a basic arithmetic calculator using assembly code. I had some trouble finding a good platform to do this project on and I had to use a web based one with little features. It required a lot of outside the box thinking.</p>

                        <h3>Spirit Bear Coffee presentation</h3>
                        <p>This project was about finding a Canadian company and rating it by its ethical practices. Spirit Bear is owned by indigenous people and frequently donates to indigenous communities so it passed with flying colours.</p>

                        <h3>Intro To Networking Case Study</h3>
                        <p>This project had me and my group set up a topology, subnet several network addresses and run static routes. It definitely was the most complicated project of last year.</p>

                        <h3>3DS XL Repair</h3>
                        <p>This project is still a work in progress, I need to save some money to get repair materials first. I need to replace the bottom mid frame since the joint is crached and I need to both replace the faulty charging port and replace the swollen battery.</p>
