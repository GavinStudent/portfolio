I didn't directly copy any code but I learned and used these methods from outside the class



viewport dimensions:

PC: 960px min width, I used this size since it was used in the class example and it encompasses what I think is the minimum size of a pc.

Tablet: min-width:481px and max-width:960px, this was also the example size used in class and it is the standard size of a tablet just from eyeballing its size on my laptop. It's around less than half of my laptop's monitor.

Phone: max width 480px, this was also the example size for a phone in class, and it's around a quarter of my laptop's screen which should be enough size for a phone.


Gradient: I used a linear gradient in the body of all of my webpages 

Colour-Scheme: the colour scheme I mostly adhered to is light blue, cyan, orange, brown, dark blue and dark green. I thought this colours scheme looked really professional, but in practice I think I chose the wrong colours in certain areas. Some of my pages look like mint chocolate chip ice cream.
